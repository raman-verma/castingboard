[Thanks Net Ninja for such useful video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnUd31TvBoU]

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## For collaborators

Individuals making valuable contributions are encouraged to be added as collaborators (commit access).

- **Work in branches then send a PR.** Just because you have full commit access doesn't mean you shouldn't use pull requests. PRs are a great way to solicit feedback from co-collaborators and to give them a nice overview of what's going on.

- **Push directly for micro-fixes only.** Only push to `master` for trivial updates that would be too noisy to notify your teammates of, such as typo fixes.

- **Keep history clean.** No `--force` pushing on branches that aren't yours.

- **Communicate.** You can use GitHub issues to communicate with your co-collaborators. Feel free to `@mention` them in issues.

- **Be nice.** The collaborator team is nice, so we are all nice.

## How to Collaborate

- For small projects where you are basically in the same physical space (e.g. lab with offices near each other).
- Be careful! You are cloning the main repository.
- Everyone has push and pull access to the central repo, so be careful and:
- Never commit to the master directly.
- Always do your work on a different branch from master.

**BASIC SHARED REPOSITORY WORKFLOW**

- update your local repo with `git pull origin master`,
- create a working branch with `git checkout -b MyNewBranch`
- make your changes on your branch and stage them with `git add`,
- commit your changes locally with `git commit -m "description of your commit"`, and
- upload the changes (including your new branch) to GitHub with `git push origin MyNewBranch`
- Go to the main repo on GitHub where you should now see your new branch
- click on your branch name
- click on “Pull Request” button (URC)
- click on “Send Pull Request”
